We went to see the Thác Prenn waterfalls that were closed the day before. Besides seeing the waterfall you can also ride ostriches, elephants and camels there. Although I enjoy seeing these animals I would never ride an animal in captivity. Many people there thought otherwise and rode the poor and exhausted ostriches which you can see in a picture below.

After the Thác Prenn waterfalls we went on to see the so called Valley of Love in the north of Đà Lạt. They have an artificial lake surrounded by a beatiful forest. The valley is mostly targeted at couples because besides a walk in the valley you can have romantic boatrides in swan shaped paddleboats. We did not choose the romantic boat rides for obvious reasons and rather decided to ride the motorbikes through the valleys around Đà Lạt until our bus to Nha Trang would depart later in the afternoon.

Our bus departed right on schedule and it took us four hours in a nice air conditioned bus for 40K Đồng to reach Nha Trang. On the bus ride we booked our flight back to Hà Nội because traveling by train or bus back to Hà Nội would have taken too much time. We also had a look into the hotels in Nha Trang and decided to have a look in a more expensive hotel with a nice view above the roofs of Nha Trang right to the sea. 

On arrival in Nha Trang we realised, that Nha Trang is a magnet for russian tourists. We hardly saw any vietnamese people on the streets. Even the hotel we chose was fully booked out with russians. After further investigation of many tripadvisor posts we decided to try a hostel that was not far away from the hotel. It did not have a nice sea view but that did not matter that much anymore. We just wanted to escape the russian invasion.

If you ever want to visit Nha Trang do yourself a favor and stay at the [Mojzo Inn](http://www.mojzo-inn.com/). The staff there is really nice and although they had no room left for us they organized a room in a nearby hostel and offered us to have breakfast at their place as well as inviting us to come over whenever we needed an advise. The staff also remembers the names of every guest they have and greet you everytime they see you around.

The rest of the day we spent on planning our next day. We wanted to visit all the islands at the bay of Nha Trang by boat. The islands to visit are [Hòn Miễu](http://goo.gl/maps/9Yxyj) where you can visit the Tri Nguyen Aquarium, Hòn Tằm, Hòn Mun, Hòn Một and finally Vinpearl. For that you mostly have only one option. Opt in for a boat ride with fifty other people crammed together on a tiny boat. The boat ride to the first island is about three hours in total where you get some cheap entertainment like singing karaoke or dancing. That was not what we felt to do. Upon further google searches we found a travel agency just around the corner that would offer custom boat rides besides the crammed tourist rides. Thanh called them and we negotiated to have a private speed boat for the two of us that would get us from island to island and would be ready whenever we wanted to hop to the next island. For a total of around 1.4M Đồng per person. It obviously was a no-brainer what we would choose to get around the islands.

We spent the evening at the [Cuốn Cuốn Rolls & BBQ Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Cuon-Cuon-Rolls-BBQ-Restaurant/583231361748735) and rolled us some fresh spring rolls along with a little barbecue served right at the table.
