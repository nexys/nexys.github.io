We were fetched by a driver at 8:00 AM who brought us to the pier where our speedboat already waited for us. The ride began and we first went to [Hòn Miễu](http://goo.gl/maps/9Yxyj) where we visited the Tri Nguyen Aquarium. After calling our water taxi again we went to Hòn Mun which is the island that is the furthest away from the coast. We did not book the ride with a diving session so there was not much else to see at Hòn Mun island except for the corals underwater so we went on to the next island.

Hòn Tằm is very beautiful. It has a nice beach with a fantastic look on the coast line of Nha Trang. It was still very early in the morning so we had no problem to find a good place on the beach to enjoy the sun. As the beach got more crowded we decided to move on to the area around Hòn Một where many floating fish markets are. Our driver showed us one of these floating fish markets and we were allowed to have a look into their fish tanks. Besides lobsters, squids and sea urchins they had a lot of other exotic fish that you could buy.

Our last destination by water was the biggest island named Vinpearl. It has an amusement park on it and we spent a lot of time riding some carnival rides and playing almost all games in the indoor gaming hall. 
All islands had an entry fee which varied from 40K to 430K Đồng. Although Vinpearl was the most expensive island it had a ride with the 3 km long cable car back to Nha Trang included. The cable car from Vinpearl to Nha Trang is the longest cable car over water in the world.
