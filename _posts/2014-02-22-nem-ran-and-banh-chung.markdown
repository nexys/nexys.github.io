I got woken up by vietnamese conversations in the kitchen downstairs after a long sleep. I knew that a big dinner  for some friends and family was planned today. I did not knew that the preparation for this dinner would last almost the whole day. After a quick shower I went downstairs to see what Thanhs family was preparing. Thanh was still sleeping so I basically got to watch the whole thing until Thanh woke up and helped me to translate my questions that I had. As it turns out they were preparing [Bánh chưng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A1nh_ch%C6%B0ng), a traditional rice cake that consists of rice, pork and mung beans. All ingredients are packed together in a specific order in four leafs from the [Lá dong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1_dong) plant. Everything gets formed into a square package that is then bundled up with two bamboo strings. Only a short introduction was needed by a friend of the family to get me ready to craft my first Bánh chưng. It went pretty well and the two Bánh chưng I made are about to finish cooking with the others in a big pot on the roof of our house after nearly ten hours.

The preparations for a dinner can last a whole day especially when Bánh chưng is made. Thanh and I went out to meet some of his friends in a [coffee shop](https://de-de.facebook.com/LaGente.coffee). I learned a lot more about the society and especially the young people in Vietnam. A lot of young people in Vietnam decide to study in the financial and business area after high school. It is also very common to marry young. Two of Thanhs friends were already married and were my age. The income is also lower than in Germany. A teacher for example earns about 4M Đồng (~130€) a month with variable supplements included. Groceries can have nearly the same prices as in Germany or are even more expensive. Cooking oil has nearly the same price and milk is more expensive. Thanh told me that renting a flat in Vietnam is rather uncommon. A lot of people get houses from their families or flats that are paid by the company they work for. Without rent it is realistic to get along with 4M Đồng a month and even be a smoker. A pack of Malboro cigarettes is only 26K Đồng (~0,90€).

The dinner in the evening was a great experience. Twelve people gathered around a table packed with a variety of vietnamese food. All kinds of vegetables and salad with or without a dressing, [Nem rán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nem_ran) (vietnamese spring rolls), fried chicken, [Phở gà](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho) and some kind of stew with pork. Everything could be seasoned with a vietnamese [sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc_ch%E1%BA%A5m#N.C6.B0.E1.BB.9Bc_m.E1.BA.AFm_pha)  made with vinegar, sugar, water, lime and fish sauce. For desert we ate home made Mứt Gừng (vietnamese candied ginger) and other sweets like Kẹo lạc (bars made of sesame and peanuts) also known as the "chocolate of vietnam". It got rounded up with a cup of [Trà sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_lotus_tea) (green lotus flavoured tea) and a slice of guava. From all the food I liked the vietnamese spring rolls best. They are not comparable to any spring rolls i ate before. Forget the frozen glutamate rolls you can get at german super markets, they have nothing to do with asian food except the name.
I am rather full now and I once again call it a day and leave you with an impression of our dinner table from this evening.
