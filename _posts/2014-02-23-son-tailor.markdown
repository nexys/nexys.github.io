We had to get up really early today to fetch some camera equipment for our trip to Sài Gòn. Thanks to a family friend we now have a Canon EOS 5d mkII with a 24-105mm 4.0 L lens. Prepare yourself for some really good pictures and 1080p video material.

For breakfast we decided to eat at one of the many cooking kitchens. I had different kinds of pork meat. Cooked pork, something that had the consistency and taste of german Leberkäse and a boiled and fried egg all along with two bouls of rice. In germany the breakfast usually does not last very long. Here I don't need anything to eat after such a breakfast until the evening.
For this journey I only packed clothes for one week so today was the first time I had to do some of my laundry. I decided to bring it to a nearby laundry to get them cleaned until we travel to Sài Gòn tomorrow. Even on sundays this is no big problem. Almost every store is open seven days a week.

After we brought my clothes to the laundry we met with a friend of Thanh. As we were sitting in a café I mentioned that I don't have any clothes to wear for the two weddings we are invited to and that I probably need a suit. Thanhs friend mentioned that he knows a very good tailor around his corner that he could ask if they can tailor me a suit. 5 minutes after we left the café he called and told me that it would be no problem. We just had to go over there to get my measurements taken. We went there and I chose a black fabric from a variety of fabrics and the finished suit would cost me 7.5M Đồng (~255€). I just had to come back in the evening to try the first prototype of the suit.

Today was also the first wedding we had to attend. After we picked up some relatives of Thanh we drove to a more rural area of Hà Nội where Thanhs grandfather grew up. The wedding was astonishing. There were at least 300 people sitting in different houses along a very small side street. They were all at least as astouned as me as we saw each other. We were guided to a table and could have as many food as we like. Thanh told me that they party for two days. One day is dedicated to the bride and the other day to the groom.
When the party got really going with loud karaoke singing in one of the houses we had to go because we had to visit a few other relatives in this town.

After a long evening going to the tailor to try on the first prototype of the suit was the last thing I did. It is incredible how fast things can be done here. There were only a few hours between taking my measurements and the first fitting. I can really recommend Sơn Tailor if you ever happen to find yourself in need for a suit in Hà Nội.
