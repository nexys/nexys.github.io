Our journey through the south of Vietnam started today. The first stop was Sài Gòn where the weather was 34°C and ~50% humidity instead of ~20°C and 98% humidity in Hà Nội. We got picked up from the Airport by a family friend who told us where our hotel would be. The hotel was owned by a nephew of another family friend, so we already had a cheap place to stay for the night. We even got our own motorbike for the day. It was lunchtime after we checked in at the hotel so we went eating at a street kitchen where we also got our motorbike from a friend.

After lunch we went to explore Sài Gòn on our own. The traffic in Sài Gòn is by far the worst and we had only one mirror on our motorbike that was broken. Fortunately there are a lot of shops on the side of the street that sell motorbike repair parts, so we got ourselfs a new mirror and managed to get through the traffic it without any major incidents.

We picked up a friend of Thanh who works at KPMG Vietnam and went for a walk through the city and went to a very good restaurant afterwards. It is a restaurant that seems to be recommended a lot of tourist guides because it was almost fully booked. Thanhs cousin as well as her husband and wife joined us later and we had really great food. We had a hot pot in the middle of the table and a lot of raw ingredients around it like a variety of vegetables and seafood that could be put in the pot.

We ended the evening with a nice cup of vietnamese coffee and after we got back to our hotel we wanted to take a shower and to have warm water in vietnam you always have to switch on the boiler first. I switched on the button and... total darkness. We thought it was only the fuse of our room but after further examination we realized that the electricity in the whole street went down. About 2 minutes later the electricity went back on so we could have a shower and went to bed afterwards.
